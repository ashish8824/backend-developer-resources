# Day 2: Control Flow (if/else, switch, for loop)

> **Goal for today:** Learn how to make your program make decisions (`if/else`, `switch`) and repeat actions (`for` loop — the ONLY loop keyword in Go). By the end, you'll understand every way Go controls the flow of a program.

---

## 1. What is "Control Flow"? (Concept First)

So far, in Day 1, our programs ran **top to bottom, one line after another**, with no decisions being made. That's called **sequential execution**.

But real programs need to:
- Make **decisions** ("if the user is over 18, allow login; otherwise, deny")
- **Repeat** actions ("print numbers 1 to 100")

**Control flow** is the general term for any code structure that controls *which lines run* and *how many times* they run, instead of just running straight top-to-bottom.

```
 Normal flow:            With control flow:
 Line 1                  Line 1
 Line 2                  Line 2 --> decision --> Line 3a  OR  Line 3b
 Line 3                  Line 4 (loop back to Line 2, repeat 5 times)
 Line 4
```

---

## 2. The `if` Statement

An `if` statement lets your program **check a condition** and run code only if that condition is `true`.

### Basic Syntax

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    age := 20

    if age >= 18 {
        fmt.Println("You are an adult.")
    }
}
```

**Line-by-line breakdown:**
- `age := 20` — declares a variable `age` holding the value 20 (recall from Day 1: `:=` infers the type automatically, here it becomes `int`).
- `if age >= 18 {` — this checks: "is the value inside `age` greater than or equal to 18?" `>=` is a **comparison operator** (compares two values and returns `true` or `false`).
- If the condition is `true`, the code inside the `{ }` braces runs. If `false`, it's skipped entirely.

**Important Go-specific rule:** Unlike some languages, Go does **NOT require parentheses** `()` around the condition, but curly braces `{}` are **mandatory**, even for a single line inside. This is different from Java, where you *can* skip braces for single-line ifs — Go never lets you skip them.

```go
// Go style (correct):
if age >= 18 {
    fmt.Println("Adult")
}

// This would NOT compile in Go (missing braces):
// if age >= 18
//     fmt.Println("Adult")
```

### `if / else`

```go
if age >= 18 {
    fmt.Println("You are an adult.")
} else {
    fmt.Println("You are a minor.")
}
```
- If the condition is `true`, the first block runs.
- If `false`, the `else` block runs instead.
- Only ONE of the two blocks ever executes — never both.

### `if / else if / else` (multiple conditions)

```go
marks := 75

if marks >= 90 {
    fmt.Println("Grade: A")
} else if marks >= 75 {
    fmt.Println("Grade: B")
} else if marks >= 50 {
    fmt.Println("Grade: C")
} else {
    fmt.Println("Grade: F")
}
```

Go checks conditions **top to bottom**, and stops at the **first one that's true**. Here, `marks = 75`. Go checks `marks >= 90` → false. Then `marks >= 75` → true! So it prints "Grade: B" and skips everything below, even though `marks >= 50` is also technically true.

### Visual Flow Diagram

```
              ┌───────────────┐
              │  marks >= 90? │
              └───────┬───────┘
                 yes  │  no
          ┌───────────┘     └───────────┐
          v                             v
     Grade: A                  ┌────────────────┐
                                │  marks >= 75?  │
                                └───────┬────────┘
                                  yes   │   no
                          ┌─────────────┘   └──────────────┐
                          v                                 v
                     Grade: B                     ┌────────────────┐
                                                    │  marks >= 50?  │
                                                    └───────┬────────┘
                                                     yes    │    no
                                              ┌─────────────┘   └────┐
                                              v                       v
                                        Grade: C                 Grade: F
```

### Special Go Feature: `if` with a short initialization statement

Go lets you declare a variable **right inside the `if` statement**, scoped only to that if/else block. This is a very idiomatic (commonly used, "the Go way") pattern.

```go
if score := 85; score >= 80 {
    fmt.Println("Great job! Score:", score)
} else {
    fmt.Println("Keep trying. Score:", score)
}
// score doesn't exist here anymore — it only lived inside the if/else block
```

- The part before the `;` (semicolon) — `score := 85` — runs first and declares `score`.
- Then the condition `score >= 80` is checked.
- `score` is only accessible **inside** this if/else block. Outside of it, `score` doesn't exist. This is called **variable scope** — where a variable is "visible" and usable.

**Why is this useful?** It's commonly used when you call a function that returns a value AND an error together (you'll see this heavily from Day 8 onward with error handling), like:
```go
if value, err := someFunction(); err == nil {
    fmt.Println("Success:", value)
}
```

## 3. Comparison and Logical Operators (needed for conditions)

### Comparison Operators
| Operator | Meaning | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `==` | equal to | `age == 18` |
| `!=` | not equal to | `age != 18` |
| `>` | greater than | `age > 18` |
| `<` | less than | `age < 18` |
| `>=` | greater than or equal to | `age >= 18` |
| `<=` | less than or equal to | `age <= 18` |

**Common beginner mistake:** Using `=` (single equals, which is **assignment** — putting a value into a variable) instead of `==` (double equals, which **compares** two values). Go's compiler will actually catch this particular mistake for you and refuse to compile, unlike some languages — one small safety net Go gives you.

### Logical Operators
| Operator | Meaning | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `&&` | AND — both conditions must be true | `age >= 18 && hasID == true` |
| `\|\|` | OR — at least one condition must be true | `age < 18 \|\| isBanned == true` |
| `!` | NOT — reverses true/false | `!isBanned` (means "is NOT banned") |

Example:
```go
age := 20
hasTicket := true

if age >= 18 && hasTicket {
    fmt.Println("Entry allowed")
} else {
    fmt.Println("Entry denied")
}
```
Here, BOTH `age >= 18` and `hasTicket` must be `true` for entry to be allowed, because of `&&`.

---

## 4. The `switch` Statement

`switch` is used when you have **many possible values** to check against a single variable — it's a cleaner alternative to writing many `else if` statements in a row.

### Basic Example

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    day := 3

    switch day {
    case 1:
        fmt.Println("Monday")
    case 2:
        fmt.Println("Tuesday")
    case 3:
        fmt.Println("Wednesday")
    case 4:
        fmt.Println("Thursday")
    default:
        fmt.Println("Some other day")
    }
}
```
Output: `Wednesday`

**Breakdown:**
- `switch day {` — tells Go "compare the value of `day` against each `case` below."
- `case 3:` — if `day` equals 3, run this block.
- `default:` — runs only if NONE of the `case` values matched. It's optional but good practice to include.

### Big Interview Point: Go's `switch` does NOT "fall through" by default

In many other languages (like Java, C), if a `case` matches, execution continues into the NEXT case too, unless you explicitly add a `break` statement. This is called **fall-through**, and forgetting `break` is a classic bug in those languages.

**Go is different and safer:** Once a matching `case` runs, Go **automatically stops** — no fall-through, no need for `break`. This was an intentional design decision to prevent bugs.

```go
day := 2
switch day {
case 1:
    fmt.Println("Monday")
case 2:
    fmt.Println("Tuesday")   // <- only THIS prints
case 3:
    fmt.Println("Wednesday")
}
// Output: Tuesday (and nothing else, even though there's no 'break')
```

### If you WANT fall-through (rare, but possible)
Go gives you the `fallthrough` keyword to explicitly force it, if you ever need that specific behavior:
```go
switch day {
case 1:
    fmt.Println("Monday")
    fallthrough
case 2:
    fmt.Println("Tuesday")
}
// if day == 1, this prints BOTH "Monday" AND "Tuesday"
```

### Multiple values in a single case

```go
switch day {
case 6, 7:
    fmt.Println("Weekend")
default:
    fmt.Println("Weekday")
}
```
If `day` is 6 OR 7, it matches this single case.

### `switch` without a condition (acts like a cleaner if/else chain)

```go
marks := 75

switch {
case marks >= 90:
    fmt.Println("Grade: A")
case marks >= 75:
    fmt.Println("Grade: B")
case marks >= 50:
    fmt.Println("Grade: C")
default:
    fmt.Println("Grade: F")
}
```
This is functionally identical to the if/else-if chain we wrote earlier, just written in switch form. Many Go developers prefer this style when checking many conditions — it's considered cleaner to read.

---

## 5. The `for` Loop — Go's ONLY Loop Keyword

This is a major, very common interview point: **Go has only ONE loop keyword: `for`.** Other languages have `while`, `do-while`, `for`, `foreach` as separate keywords. Go uses `for` for ALL of these situations, just written differently.

### Form 1: Traditional counting loop (like a normal "for loop" in other languages)

```go
for i := 0; i < 5; i++ {
    fmt.Println(i)
}
```
Output:
```
0
1
2
3
4
```

**Breakdown of the three parts (separated by semicolons):**
1. `i := 0` — **initialization**: runs once, before the loop starts. Creates a counter variable `i` starting at 0.
2. `i < 5` — **condition**: checked before EVERY loop run. As long as this is `true`, the loop continues. The moment it's `false`, the loop stops.
3. `i++` — **post statement**: runs after each loop iteration completes. `i++` means "increase `i` by 1" (shorthand for `i = i + 1`).

### Visual Flow

```
   i := 0  (runs once)
      │
      v
┌──────────────┐
│   i < 5 ?     │<─────────────┐
└──────┬───────┘               │
   yes │  no                   │
       v                       │
  run loop body            i++ │
  (print i)                    │
       │                       │
       └───────────────────────┘
       no ──> exit loop, continue rest of program
```

### Form 2: "while loop" style (condition only)

Since Go has no separate `while` keyword, you simply drop the initialization and post statement:

```go
count := 0
for count < 5 {
    fmt.Println(count)
    count++
}
```
This behaves exactly like a `while` loop in other languages — it keeps running as long as `count < 5` stays true. Note: you must manually increase `count` inside the loop body, or it will loop forever!

### Form 3: Infinite loop

```go
for {
    fmt.Println("This runs forever unless stopped")
    break // stops the loop manually
}
```
Dropping ALL three parts creates an infinite loop. You must use `break` (explained below) somewhere inside to eventually stop it, or the program will run forever (and likely crash or freeze).

### Form 4: `for-range` loop (looping over collections — very commonly used)

This is used to loop through things like strings, arrays, slices, and maps (we'll cover these in-depth on Day 4). A quick preview:

```go
fruits := []string{"apple", "banana", "cherry"}

for index, value := range fruits {
    fmt.Println(index, value)
}
```
Output:
```
0 apple
1 banana
2 cherry
```
- `range fruits` goes through each item in the `fruits` list one at a time.
- `index` = the position (0, 1, 2...)
- `value` = the actual item at that position

If you only need the value, not the index, use an underscore `_` (called the **blank identifier** — it tells Go "I don't need this value, don't complain that I'm not using it"):
```go
for _, value := range fruits {
    fmt.Println(value)
}
```

---

## 6. `break` and `continue`

These give you extra control INSIDE a loop.

### `break` — exits the loop immediately

```go
for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {
    if i == 5 {
        break // stop the loop entirely once i reaches 5
    }
    fmt.Println(i)
}
// Output: 0 1 2 3 4  (stops before printing 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)
```

### `continue` — skips the CURRENT iteration only, then continues the loop

```go
for i := 0; i < 5; i++ {
    if i == 2 {
        continue // skip printing when i is 2, but keep looping
    }
    fmt.Println(i)
}
// Output: 0 1 3 4  (2 is skipped, but loop still continues to 3, 4)
```

**Key difference (common interview question):**
- `break` = "stop the loop completely, get out."
- `continue` = "skip just this one round, but keep going with the next round."

### Labels (for breaking out of nested loops)

If you have a loop inside another loop (a "nested loop"), a plain `break` only exits the *innermost* loop. To break out of an OUTER loop directly, Go allows **labels**:

```go
outerLoop:
    for i := 0; i < 3; i++ {
        for j := 0; j < 3; j++ {
            if j == 1 {
                break outerLoop // breaks BOTH loops, not just the inner one
            }
            fmt.Println(i, j)
        }
    }
```
- `outerLoop:` is a label — just a name you give to a loop.
- `break outerLoop` tells Go exactly which loop to break out of, instead of just the nearest/innermost one.

This is a slightly advanced feature — you won't use it every day, but interviewers sometimes test if you know it exists.

## 7. Common Beginner Mistakes

1. **Forgetting curly braces** — Go always requires `{ }` even for single-line if/for bodies (unlike some languages).
2. **Using `=` instead of `==`** in conditions — Go's compiler catches this for you, which is a helpful safety net.
3. **Infinite loop by forgetting to update the loop variable** in a while-style `for` loop (forgetting `count++`).
4. **Assuming switch falls through** like Java/C — remember, Go's `switch` stops automatically after a matching case.
5. **Trying to use a variable declared inside `if`'s short statement outside the if/else block** — remember, it only exists within that scope.

---

## 8. Day 2 Practice Exercise

Write a program that:
1. Loops from 1 to 20 using a `for` loop.
2. For each number, prints "Fizz" if divisible by 3, "Buzz" if divisible by 5, "FizzBuzz" if divisible by both, otherwise prints the number itself.

(This is the famous "FizzBuzz" problem — a very common warm-up interview coding question!)

<details>
<summary>Click to see solution</summary>

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    for i := 1; i <= 20; i++ {
        if i%3 == 0 && i%5 == 0 {
            fmt.Println("FizzBuzz")
        } else if i%3 == 0 {
            fmt.Println("Fizz")
        } else if i%5 == 0 {
            fmt.Println("Buzz")
        } else {
            fmt.Println(i)
        }
    }
}
```
**New operator used:** `%` is the **modulus operator** — it gives the *remainder* after division. `i % 3 == 0` means "i is perfectly divisible by 3 (no remainder)."
</details>

## 9. Day 2 Interview Questions (Quick Prep)

1. **Q: How many loop keywords does Go have, and what is it/are they?**
   A: Only one — `for`. It's used to replicate `while`, `do-while`, infinite loops, and `foreach`-style iteration, just written differently.

2. **Q: Does Go's `switch` statement fall through to the next case by default?**
   A: No. Go automatically stops after a matching case runs. Use the `fallthrough` keyword if you explicitly want fall-through behavior.

3. **Q: What's the difference between `break` and `continue`?**
   A: `break` exits the loop entirely. `continue` skips only the current iteration and moves to the next one.

4. **Q: Can you declare a variable inside an `if` statement in Go? What's its scope?**
   A: Yes, using the short statement form (`if x := 5; x > 0 {...}`). The variable is scoped only to that if/else block — it doesn't exist outside it.

5. **Q: Are parentheses required around conditions in `if` statements in Go?**
   A: No, parentheses are optional/not used conventionally, but curly braces `{}` are always mandatory.

6. **Q: How do you break out of a nested (outer) loop in Go?**
   A: Using labels — e.g., `outerLoop: for {...}` and then `break outerLoop` inside the inner loop.

---

## Summary of Day 2

- `if / else if / else` lets your program make decisions based on conditions.
- Go requires `{}` always, but parentheses around conditions are not used.
- You can declare a scoped variable directly inside an `if` using `if x := val; condition {}`.
- `switch` is a cleaner way to check many possible values, and does NOT fall through by default (unlike Java/C).
- `for` is Go's only loop keyword — it handles traditional counting loops, while-style loops, infinite loops, and range-based iteration over collections.
- `break` exits a loop completely; `continue` skips just the current round.
- Labels let you break out of nested/outer loops directly.

**Tomorrow (Day 3):** We'll learn Functions in Go — how to define them, Go's unique ability to return multiple values from one function, named return values, variadic functions (functions that accept any number of arguments), and closures (functions that "remember" variables from where they were created).
